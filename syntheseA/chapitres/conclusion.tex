\chapter*{Conclusion}

At the end of our project, we recalled that we wanted to optimize the commercial management of a company, AMD in our case through the use of a data warehouse that could be exploited for analysis and reporting purposes, making making decisions much easier for decision-makers and company salespeople. As a result, we carried out an analysis that allowed the design of a commercial management data warehouse, from which the datamarts for analysis and visualization emerged. With two dashboards to our credit in this project that allow an easy view of the evolution of certain critical trends, we can say that we have achieved our overall objective.
