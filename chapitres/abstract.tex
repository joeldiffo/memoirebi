The many benefits that Business Intelligence (BI) tools bring to companies has lead us into an era where business decisions will be significantly improved through the use of BI. Companies like AMD Sarl have large amounts of untapped data that can bring value to the business if used properly. This data can be consolidated alongside commercial data from other sources in a datawarehouse which will then be exploited through data visualization tools which will aim to represent this aggregated data in graphical form, thus greatly facilitating understanding for decision-makers and the company's salespeople. We decided to implement our system with the Microsoft Business Intelligence toolset.
